Mon-O-News

The website is a Pokemon fan site to update fans on the latest news and releases.
It allows them to discuss on articles and topics, as well as seeing the latest news.

Design Process
I wanted this to be a fan site where people can get news fast and reliably. Instead of needing to click on a link to get the news, I want to show brief previews of the contents at the start to allow users to see which article piques their interest.
I wanted each page to link to the other pages for quick and easy access so that users don't have to constantly go back and forth to go to different pages.
I added brief summaries of discussion topics and a comments feature so that users can comment on threads that they are interested in and read up what the thread is about.
The front page has some pictures and descriptions of new pokemon so that users will get caught up to speed and can scroll down to see more if they're interested. It also links to the official site.

Features
There are link to the official site.
There are links to other pages of the site.
There are comment features.

Existing Features
Official site link - allows users to go to the official pokemon site by cicking the link
Other pages link - allows users to access other pages of the site by clicking the links
Comments- allows users to input comments on discussion pages by typing into the comments section
...
Stuff to do:
Divide each section into boxes more obviously/clearly.
Alter text to make it clear.
Make images and text for pokemon in homepage more neatly aligned in columns with clear divisions.
Overall, make the site more streamlined and neat.

Testing
For any scenarios that have not been automated, test the user stories manually and provide as much detail as is relevant. A particularly useful form for describing your testing process is via scenarios, such as:

Contact form:
Go to the "Contact Us" page
Try to submit the empty form and verify that an error message about the required fields appears
Try to submit the form with an invalid email address and verify that a relevant error message appears
Try to submit the form with all inputs valid and verify that a success message appears.
In addition, you should mention in this section how your project looks and works on different browsers and screen sizes.

You should also mention in this section any interesting bugs or problems you discovered during your testing, even if you haven't addressed them yet.

If this section grows too long, you may want to split it off into a separate file and link to it from here.
